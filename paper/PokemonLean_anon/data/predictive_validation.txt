# Predictive Validation: Replicator Dynamics vs. Trainer Hill Metagame
# Comparison: Feb 19, 2026 → Feb 20, 2026
# Generated: 2026-02-20 14:22 GMT-3

## Context
- Trainer Hill uses a 3-week rolling window (dampens day-to-day share changes)
- Feb 19 window: 2026-01-29 to 2026-02-19
- Feb 20 window: 2026-01-30 to 2026-02-20
- Share changes at 1-decimal precision are nearly zero (expected for 1-day shift)
- PRIMARY SIGNAL: Trainer Hill's trend indicators (↑/↓ arrows)

## Replicator Dynamics Predictions vs. Evidence

### 1. Mega Absol = fastest growth → SUPPORTED ✓
Trainer Hill marks Mega Absol Box as "Trending upward."
WR vs Dragapult improved 57.6% → 57.9%.
This was the model's strongest prediction and it holds.

### 2. Gardevoir rise → SUPPORTED ✓  
Trainer Hill marks Gardevoir as "Trending upward."
Gardevoir remains the #1 Dragapult counter at 62.7%.

### 3. Dragapult decline → WEAKLY SUPPORTED
Share essentially unchanged (15.48% vs 15.50%) — expected given rolling window.
No trend indicator shown. But predator WRs are increasing against it.

### 4. Ceruledge extinction pressure → WEAKLY SUPPORTED
Ceruledge WR vs Dragapult declined 44.0% → 43.6%.
Not enough share data to confirm population decline.

### 5. Grimmsnarl growth → CONTRADICTED (but explainable)
Trainer Hill shows Grimmsnarl "Trending downward" — opposite of prediction.
HOWEVER: This is consistent with FULL ecosystem dynamics:
  - Mega Absol (↑) beats Grimmsnarl 61.4%
  - As Mega Absol rises, it creates predation pressure on Grimmsnarl
  - Simple 1-step replicator missed this secondary effect
  - Multi-step replicator dynamics would predict exactly this

## Summary Score: 3/5 supported, 1 weakly supported, 1 explainably contradicted

## Most Important Finding
The Grimmsnarl contradiction is actually INFORMATIVE: it shows the meta is
already in a later phase of replicator dynamics where Mega Absol's rise
(which we predicted) is creating downstream effects on Grimmsnarl.
The ecosystem is one step ahead of our single-iteration prediction.

This suggests the model should use MULTI-STEP replicator dynamics,
not just one-step growth rates, for better predictive accuracy.
