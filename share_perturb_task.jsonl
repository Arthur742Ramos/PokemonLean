{"task": "Create PokemonLean/PokemonLean/SharePerturbation.lean with formal share perturbation theorems.\n\nRead PokemonLean/PokemonLean/RealMetagame.lean to understand how meta shares and matchup rates are encoded. The key idea: expected WR vs field depends on what opponents play. If meta shares shift, expected WRs change.\n\nThe expected WR of deck i vs the field is:\n  E[WR_i] = Σ_j (share_j / (1 - share_i)) * matchup(i,j)\nwhere share_j is opponent j's share, normalized to exclude deck i itself.\n\nCURRENT SHARES (from RealMetagame.lean):\nDragapult 155/1000, Gholdengo 99/1000, Grimmsnarl 51/1000, MegaAbsol 50/1000, Gardevoir 46/1000, CharizardNoc 43/1000, GardJell 42/1000, CharPid 35/1000, DragChar 35/1000, RagBolt 33/1000, NsZoro 30/1000, Alakazam 28/1000, Kangaskhan 25/1000, Ceruledge 23/1000\n\nKEY MATCHUP RATES (from RealMetagame.lean — read the file to get exact rationals):\n- Dragapult vs Grimmsnarl: 386/1000 (38.6%)\n- Grimmsnarl vs Dragapult: 572/1000 (57.2%)\n- etc. (use the full 14x14 matrix from the file)\n\nTHEOREMS TO PROVE:\n\n1. paradox_holds_drag_at_10pct:\n   If Dragapult share drops to 100/1000 (10%) and the freed 5.5% is distributed proportionally among other decks, recompute expected WRs. Prove Dragapult expected WR is still < 50%.\n\n2. paradox_holds_drag_at_5pct:\n   If Dragapult share drops to 50/1000 (5%), redistributed proportionally, Dragapult expected WR still < 50%.\n\n3. grimmsnarl_stays_best_at_10pct:\n   If Grimmsnarl rises to 100/1000 (10%) with share taken proportionally from others, Grimmsnarl expected WR is still > 50% and still highest among top decks.\n\n4. grimmsnarl_stays_best_at_15pct:\n   If Grimmsnarl becomes the most popular at 155/1000 (15.5%, swapping with Dragapult's current share), does it still have > 50% expected WR?\n\n5. paradox_independent_of_popularity:\n   The key insight: Dragapult's BAD matchup spread (loses to 9/13) means it underperforms regardless of its own popularity. Prove that for ANY Dragapult share from 1% to 30%, its expected WR vs the rest of the field (with other shares proportionally adjusted) remains below 50%.\n   This might be hard to prove for arbitrary values — if so, prove it for specific sample points: 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%.\n\n6. share_sensitivity_bound:\n   Compute how much the top-6 share distribution would need to change (in L1 distance) before the tier ordering (S/A/B/C) changes. Even a rough bound is valuable.\n\nUse exact rational arithmetic. Prove with native_decide, norm_num, omega, simp. ZERO sorry.\nIf a theorem is too hard to prove, DELETE it rather than using sorry.\n\nAdd import to PokemonLean.lean if needed.\n\nCommit: feat: SharePerturbation.lean — formal meta share sensitivity analysis"}
